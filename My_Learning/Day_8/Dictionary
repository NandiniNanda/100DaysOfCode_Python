In Python, a tuple is a collection of ordered and immutable elements. Here are some key characteristics and operations related to tuples:

1. **Creation:**
    - Tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by commas inside parentheses **`()`**.
        
        ```python
        
        my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'hello')
        
        ```
        
2. **Accessing Elements:**
    - Elements of a tuple are accessed using indexing, similar to lists.
        
        ```python
        
        print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
        
        ```
        
3. **Immutable:**
    - Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed or modified.
        
        ```python
        
        # This will raise an error
        my_tuple[0] = 5
        
        ```
        
4. **Length:**
    - You can find the length (number of elements) of a tuple using the **`len()`** function.
        
        ```python
        
        print(len(my_tuple))
        
        ```
        
5. **Slicing:**
    - You can use slicing to extract a portion of the tuple.
        
        ```python
        
        subset_tuple = my_tuple[1:3]
        
        ```
        
6. **Concatenation:**
    - Tuples can be concatenated using the **`+`** operator.
        
        ```python
        
        new_tuple = my_tuple + (4, 5, 6)
        
        ```
        
7. **Repetition:**
    - Tuples can be repeated using the **``** operator.
        
        ```python
        
        repeated_tuple = my_tuple * 2
        
        ```
        
8. **Deleting:**
    - You cannot delete elements of a tuple, but you can delete the entire tuple.
        
        ```python
        
        del my_tuple
        
        ```
        
9. **Nested Tuples:**
    - Tuples can contain other tuples, creating nested structures.
        
        ```python
        
        nested_tuple = (1, (2, 3), 'hello')
        
        ```
        

Tuples are often used when you want to create an immutable sequence of elements. They are commonly used in scenarios where the data should not be modified after creation.

In Python, a tuple is a collection of ordered and immutable elements. Here are some key characteristics and operations related to tuples:

1. **Creation:**
    - Tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by commas inside parentheses **`()`**.

3. **Immutable:**

        ```python
        pythonCopy code
        # This will raise an error
        my_tuple[0] = 5
        
        ```
        
4. **Length:**

        ```

        ```python
        
        repeated_tuple = my_tuple * 2
        
        ```
