# Variables:
In Python, you can assign values to variables using the equal sign (=). Variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to declare their type explicitly.

x = 5      # x is an integer
y = 3.14   # y is a floating-point number
name = "John"  # name is a string

# Data Types:

1. Numeric Types:
int: Integer type (e.g., 5, -3).
float: Floating-point type (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).

2. Text Type:
str: String type (e.g., "Hello", 'Python').

3. Boolean Type:
bool: Boolean type (True or False).

4. Sequence Types:
list: Ordered and mutable collection.
tuple: Ordered and immutable collection.
range: Represents a sequence of numbers.

5. Set Types:
set: Unordered and mutable collection of unique elements.
frozenset: Unordered and immutable collection of unique elements.

6. Mapping Type:
dict: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.

num = 42            # int
pi = 3.14159        # float
greeting = "Hello"  # str
is_python_fun = True  # bool

my_list = [1, 2, 3]       # list
my_tuple = (4, 5, 6)      # tuple
my_set = {1, 2, 3}        # set
my_dict = {'a': 10, 'b': 20}  # dict

# Basic Operations:

1. Arithmetic Operations:

addition = 5 + 3
subtraction = 7 - 2
multiplication = 4 * 6
division = 10 / 2

2. String Operations:

greeting = "Hello"
name = "John"
full_greeting = greeting + " " + name

# Control Flow:
# Conditional Statements:

x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative")

# Loops:

1. for i in range(5):
    print(i)

2. while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
